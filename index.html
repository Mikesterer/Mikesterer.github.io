       <h2> An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency. Think of them as the rare trading yu-gi-oh cards. You would trade one Bitcoin for another Bitcoin and the value would still be the same. However you can trade your silver dragon card with a mona lisa and boom you have yourself a one of a kind masterpiece.</h2>

        <br><br><h3>Blockchain and non fungible tokens give artists and creaters a unique opportunity to monetize their wares. Back in the day artists would have to rely on galleries and acution houses to sell their work, but now there is an entirely big platform for them to sell it to the consumer as NFTs. To start your journey on acquiring NFTs, you’ll need to get a digital wallet that allows you to store NFTs and cryptocurrencies. You’ll likely need to purchase some cryptocurrency, like Ether, Bitcoin or whatever depending what your NFT marketplace accepts. You can buy crypto using a credit card on platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, eToro and even PayPal. You’ll then be able to move it from the exchange to your wallet of choice. Be mindful of the exchange fees and the fee you would pay to have your NFTs on the marketplace.</h3>
